Initial obervations:
First thing I did was delete all the old tasks and I made my own. In the process of making tasks, I did not find any bugs, so that's good.
The filtering also seems to work pretty well, both the filter by category worked, and the filter by priority worked as well.

In fact, I could not find a single bug. The only thing I notices is that there were certain things in the tasks.py file that were not implemented into the streamlit file.
